  "content": "This allows you to import structured JSON data to [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). You can use one of the following tools to extract your content and make it ready for import:\n\n#### Available exporters\n\n- [Database](https://github.com/contentful/database-exporter.rb)\n- [Wordpress](https://github.com/contentful/wordpress-exporter.rb)\n- [Drupal](https://github.com/contentful/drupal-exporter.rb)\n\n## Setup\nBefore you can import your content to Contentful, you need to extract and prepare it. We currently support the mentioned exporters, but you can also create your own tools. As a first step you should create a `settings.yml` file and fill in your credentials. **A Contentful OAuth access token can be created using the [Contentful Management API - documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/documentation/content-management-api/#getting-started)** The Contentful organization id can be found in your account settings. Once you installed the Gem and created the YAML file with the settings you can invoke the tool using:\n\n    contentful-importer --config-file settings.yml --action\n\nBefore you start importing the content make sure you read [how to use it](https://github.com/contentful/generic-importer.rb#usage) and [tested your credentials](https://github.com/contentful/generic-importer.rb#--test-credentials).\n#### Space ID\nAfter [importing the content types](https://github.com/contentful/generic-importer.rb#--import-content-types-args) to the Space, you need to specify the `space_id` parameter in the settings.",
